    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Abstract: </b>
    Borders are a precarious thing. While the identity of a nation appears as an objective entity 
    easily demarcated on a map, the realities of everyday life do not reflect as such. Drawing borders 
    n a map and labeling it with a chosen place name is only the first step in materializing assertions 
    of territorial claim. This process is made all the more precarious, contested, and often violent when 
    abstract boundaries are arbitrarily superimposed onto geographies that are religiously, culturally, 
    ethnically, and linguistically diverse. The 1947 Partition of India is a prime example of this phenomena 
    and of the violent nation-building project that ensued. During India’s independence movement Hinduism was 
    a strong motivating and unifying force, used to strengthen these new ideological and geographical borders 
    left as a legacy of British colonization. By examining examples of architecture rooted in an imagined 
    history, neighborhood mobility, and the power of place names in border regions of India, I will outline 
    the ways in which the destructive rhetoric of Hindu nationalism is reflected on the everyday landscape. 
    I argue that landscape can be used as a means towards furthering and reproducing an ideology of genocide 
    in allowing the continuation of violent placemaking and the further marginalization of India’s Muslim population.

  <h2>Historical analysis of the Urban Morphology of Surat, India: Colonization and Globalization</h2>
    <img src="images/originalGEE_Surat2020.png">
    <p>The urban morphology of Surat is still strongly tied to its history&#8211; its history as a fortress, a walled city, and a global port. 
      The city core and the fortress which stands within it is the focal point from which the rest of Surat expands outwards. 
      From village and street names, the semi circular roads that define the urban shape, the bazaars and economic culture, 
      its industry and exports, to the organic town plan of the inner city, Surat’s history is still alive. The culture and 
      community has withstood the impacts and pressure of colonialism, globalization, and rapid urbanization, 
      just as the walls and fortress once defended the flourishing port city...
